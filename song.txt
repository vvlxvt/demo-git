sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

from the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny 

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's songs
Attack!

Steel meets steel
The clash begins
Thunder roars
As glory calls from deep within

Blood and flame
Through storm and pain
We fight as one
No step in vain

Drums of war
Beat loud and near
Forward now â€”
We know no fear

for new tag
Honor bound
We make our stand
For Odin's wrath
And fatherland!
