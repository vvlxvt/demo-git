sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

from the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny 

Steel meets steel
The clash begins
Thunder roars
As glory calls from deep within

Axes rise
With burning pride
We hold the line
We shall not hide
